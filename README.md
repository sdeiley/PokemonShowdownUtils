Stupid scripts for my use related to PS

Usage: 
1. Make sure python is installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Run the relevant python script, e.g. in `terminal` on mac, run `python3 get_replay_htmls.py`

Scripts:
- `get_replay_urls.py` - simple guis take as input Pokemon Showdown username and password and list all replays for the gen9vgc2023series1 format.
- `get_replay_htmls.py` - simple guis take as input Pokemon Showdown username and password and download .html files for the gen9vgc2023series1 format.

Note: the created html files do not exactly match the files when you navigate to a saved replay url, and select the "Download" button on the page.
